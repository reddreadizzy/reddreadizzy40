  <p><strong>Artifact Focus:</strong> 
  I focused on turning small elements—a table and an image—into fully usable content for my portfolio. 
  I used the NBA 2K Skill Improvement Rubric table and the NBA 2K service page image as the basis.</p>
  
  <h3>NBA 2K Skill Improvement Rubric</h3>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Criteria</th>
        <th>Excellent (4)</th>
        <th>Proficient (3)</th>
        <th>Developing (2)</th>
        <th>Beginning (1)</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Shooting & Shot Selection</td>
        <td>Consistently takes open shots with good/excellent timing. Rarely forces shots.</td>
        <td>Usually takes good shots; occasional rushed shots.</td>
        <td>Frequently shoots contested shots; timing inconsistent.</td>
        <td>Forces shots regularly; timing rarely correct.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Ball Handling & Dribble Control</td>
        <td>Executes multiple intentional dribble moves with control and purpose.</td>
        <td>Uses at least one dribble move effectively; overall control is steady.</td>
        <td>Dribble control is shaky; moves are unintentional or mistimed.</td>
        <td>Often loses the ball; little to no understanding of dribble control.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Passing & Decision-Making</td>
        <td>Uses icon passing, makes early passes, avoids turnovers.</td>
        <td>Generally good passes with occasional turnovers; spacing awareness developing.</td>
        <td>Passing decisions inconsistent; often late or forced.</td>
        <td>Repeatedly forces passes leading to turnovers; poor spacing awareness.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Defensive Positioning</td>
        <td>Disciplined defense; uses footwork instead of reaching; stays in front consistently.</td>
        <td>Solid defensive stance; occasional missteps.</td>
        <td>Relies heavily on steal button; often out of position.</td>
        <td>Rarely stays in position; overuses steal button.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>In-Game IQ & Situational Awareness</td>
        <td>Strong understanding of spacing, timing, and shot/pass selection in multiple situations.</td>
        <td>Shows awareness in most plays; occasionally reacts late.</td>
        <td>Struggles to apply basketball IQ consistently.</td>
        <td>Minimal awareness of spacing, timing, or strategy.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h3>NBA 2K Coaching Service Image</h3>
  <img src="nba2k-cover.jpg" alt="Cover art of NBA 2K24 showing a basketball player preparing to shoot, illustrating the coaching service." style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">

  <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> These revisions make the data and visuals usable in a portfolio context. 
  The rubric is clear and scannable, and the image provides meaningful context for all users, including those relying on alt text.</p>

  <p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> Table content and image alt text were refined with AI assistance.
